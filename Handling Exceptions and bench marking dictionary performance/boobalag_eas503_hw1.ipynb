    "### Problem 1 - Testing for  Fibonacci Number (10 Points)\n",

    "\n",
    "Test if a number belongs to the Fibonacci series, using `if-else` conditions. The logic of testing if a number, $n$, belongs to the Fibonacci series is: if one or both of $(5*n^2 + 4)$ or $(5*n^2 – 4)$ is a perfect square.\n",

    "1. You will need to implement the function `fibonacciGenerator`, which takes no inputs. The function should return a Python `list` of length 25, with first 25 Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "2. You will need to define a function `fibonacciTester`, which takes a single number as input, and returns `true` if the number belongs to the Fibonacci series, and `false` otherwise. "

So the time complexity of the list is **O(n)**,In Dictionaries does not have any order of storing key-value pair so deleting an element on a particular location does not have any effect like even if delete a particular key-value pair it won't be  appending the remaining in place of deleted one since the dictionaries are unordered Data structure so the time Complexity is O(1) for the **del** operator .\n",

    "\n",
    "> Consider that you are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each containing money, one contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope at will, but before inspecting it, you are given the chance to switch envelopes. Should you switch?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The game is this: _stick_ or _switch_; It seems obvious that there is no point in switching envelopes as the situation is symmetric. However, because you stand to gain twice as much money if you switch while risking only a loss of half of what you currently have, it is possible to argue that it is more beneficial to switch.The problem is to show what is wrong with this argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Envelopes problem**: Implement a function, called `simulateProblem()`, that does the game simulation for the two envelopes problem. Run the simulation 1000 times to figure out the empirical (observed) probability of gaining more money when switching and gaining more money when sticking to the original choice. Each simulation operates as follows:\n",
    "1. First, randomly pick an envelopes configuration out of the two possible configurations, $(A,2A)$ or $(2A,A)$. In the first configuration, the second envelope has twice the money and in the second configuration, the first envelope has twice the money.\n",
    "2. Next, randomly pick one of the two envelopes. \n",
    "3. Finally, randomly choose to either stick or switch. The program checks if you won (the envelope that picked has more money) or not (the envelope that picked has less money). In case of winning, record if the winning was because of _sticking_ or _switching_.\n",
